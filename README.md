js-toolbox Node Modules
=======================

This is currently 4 npm modules that I have found useful in my community college javascript course.

[js-toolbox](js-toolbox)
----------

Class based inheritance for javascript in the style of Bootstrap.

[assert-runner](assert-runner)
-------------

Based on Gabriel Llamas' answer to [this stack overflow question.](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18185144/node-js-unit-testing-in-2013). A very lightweight node test framework.

[render-async](render-async)
-------------

The start of a framework for progressive enhancement. Without repeating oneself you can have pages that look good to  a crawler or a person without javascript in their browser as well as being single page apps if javascript is available.

[google-login](google-login)
----------------------------

Let Google handle user authentication using Oauth2. When a current user is established your logic can take over.

[mysql2-openshift](mysql2-openshift)

Simple wrapper around the real mysql2 with openshift environment variables
